To enable the futuristic UI backgrounds, please ensure the following ocean/surfing images are placed in wave_log/public/assets/ (relative to your React project's public folder):

- bg-home.jpg         (main/home section background, vibrant ocean, surf, or sunrise image)
- bg-log.jpg          (new log/session form section, close-up surfing or wave image)
- bg-details.jpg      (session details panel, stylized ocean/surfboard/underwater scene)
- bg-dashboard.jpg    (dashboard stats section, dramatic surf or ocean/sky gradient image)

Images may be JPEG or PNG, 1200px+ width preferred for clarity. The images should be visually oceanic, with good brightness and interesting wave or surfing content, and high enough contrast to work well with overlays and text.

If you place images with these names, they will be automatically loaded (thanks to CSS backgrounds) in the relevant sections!
